title: Random (Coherent?) thoughts about AI and science

**Under Construction**

Amidst all the recent buzz around machine learning and AI, I want to take a step back and understand the fundamental questions. Part of this is also my own interest in AI, which I found after dabbling around in related fields (control, statistical physics etc). I vaguely remember reading about three important questions (likely from Russel and Norvig). Essentially, three questions have been guiding the scientific pursuits of man and have created many academic disciplines â€“ some more mature than others.

1.	The origin and nature of universe
2.	The origin and nature of life
3.	The origin and nature of intelligence

(1)	is essentially studied by physics and a number of spin-off disciplines like astronomy. Given the grand aim and vast scope, this question is not likely to have a profound impact on our lives in short timescales (say decades).

(2)	kick started fields like biology, chemistry etc. By its very nature, these fields have been and will continue to profoundly impact our lives. However, there is still a non-negligible delay between scientific breakthroughs and practical implications (clinical trials, bunch of regulations etc).

### The origin and nature of intelligence
This is perhaps the most interesting question of the last few decades. AI researchers (and related sub-fields of CS, math, and physics) own this question and have been making good progress, but we are far from understanding the nature of intelligence. It has been immensely hard to even define intelligence, and for good reason.

AI is also very popular with industries, which is both a boon and bane. Much of the interest is to do with the idea of automating various tasks. From time in memorial, we have always tried to automate tasks to reduce human burden, cut costs etc. This goes back to invention of wheel, steam engine, automated farming etc. In my opinion, most tasks that are purely physical have more or less been automated. For other tasks that we would like to automate (eg driving, automatic speech recognition, real-time translation etc), a component of *intelligence* is required. The attention from the industry means ample funding and an overall optimistic culture/atmosphere. 

However, the nature of problems people have been working on is also impacted by industrial funding. Fundamental questions of AI: to build agents that make competent decisions in unstructured and unknown environments, still remain open despite the many advances.
