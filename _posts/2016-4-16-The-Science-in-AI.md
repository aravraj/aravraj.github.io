title: The science in AI

**Under Construction**

Amidst all the research, coursework, and buzz around machine learning and AI, I want to take a step back and understand the fundamental questions. I remember reading about three important questions long ago. I cannot remember the source, but it’s very likely the book by Russel and Norvig. Essentially, three questions have been guiding the scientific pursuits of man and have created many academic disciplines – some more mature than others.

1.	The origin and nature of universe
2.	The origin and nature of life
3.	The origin and nature of intelligence

(1)	Is essentially studied by physics and a number of spin-off disciplines like astronomy. Given the grand aim and vast scope, this question is not likely to have a profound impact on our lives in short timescales (say decades).

(2)	Kick started fields like biology, chemistry, medicine etc. By its very nature, these fields have been and will continue to profoundly impact our lives. However, there is still a non-negligible delay between a scientific discovery and it’s practical implications (clinical trials, bunch of regulations etc).
