I am an undergraduate researcher at IIT Madras, where I have been studying for the past four years. I am fortunate to be advised by Profs. [Ravindran](http://www.cse.iitm.ac.in/~ravi/), [Shankar Narasimhan](http://www.che.iitm.ac.in/~naras/research.htm), and Sridharakumar. I am a proud member of [RISE Lab](http://www.cse.iitm.ac.in/) and [ILDS](http://cmsrv.iitm.ac.in/ilds/home/).

After dabbling in mathematical signals & systems theory and (briefly) statistical physics, I found my calling in optimization and machine learning.

I am broadly interested in the interplay between optimization, learning, and decision theory. Consequently, my deepest interests are in reinforcement learning, stochastic optimization, and of late deep learning.
